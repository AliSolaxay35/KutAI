# Explanation For CBC Anemia Project

This Project Uses A Synthetic Dataset Named 'cbc_data_200.csv' Containing 200 Rows Of Blood Test Values Such As Hemoglobin, RBC, WBC, And Platelets, With An Anemia Label (0 = No Anemia, 1 = Anemia).  

## Jupyter Notebook Workflow
1. Data Creation And Saving As CSV.  
2. Data Loading With Pandas.  
3. Data Exploration With 'info()' And 'describe()'.  
4. Visualization Using Matplotlib And Seaborn (Histograms, Boxplots, Scatter Plots).  
5. Machine Learning Using Logistic Regression With Train-Test Split, Feature Scaling, Model Training, Predictions, And Evaluation.  

## Visual Studio Code Workflow
- The Workflow Is The Same But Written As A Single Python Script ('CBC-Anemia-Analysis.py').  
- The Script Reads The 'cbc_data_200.csv' File, Performs Data Analysis, Visualizations, And Builds A Logistic Regression Model.  

## Important Notes
- Place The File 'cbc_data_200.csv' In The Same Folder As The Python Script Or Provide The Full Path.  
- Stratified Train-Test Split Ensures Class Balance.  
- StandardScaler Normalizes Data Before Training.  
- Accuracy And Confusion Matrix Are Printed As Evaluation Metrics.  
- This Code Can Be Run In Both Jupyter Notebook (Cell-Based) And Visual Studio Code (Single Script).
