This Python Script Simulates Antibody Level Changes After Vaccination For Two Groups: Young And Elderly.  
Each Group Has Ten Participants.  
The Antibody Response Is Generated Using A Logistic Growth Function To Represent The Immune Activation Phase,  
Followed By An Exponential Decay Function To Represent The Decline Of Antibody Levels After The Peak.  

Random Noise Is Added To Each Participantâ€™s Data To Mimic Measurement Variability.  
The Script Then Calculates The Mean Antibody Response For Each Group And Plots Both The Individual And Mean Levels Over Time.  

This Model Is Useful For Illustrating Immunological Response Patterns And Can Be Adapted For Other Biological Simulations.

Thank You.
